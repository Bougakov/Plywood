DIY plywood designs for Dremel, CNC, PCB fabrication. All of these are meant to be cut from 3mm plywood.

## Circular mini saw:

44mm cutting discs for Dremel are too heavy and too dangerous. I've mounted one on M6 rod, used ball bearings and inserted the resulting shaft in a custom plywood box. The result is a tiny circular saw which is ideal for cutting PCBs. [See it in action on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyNd7t795UE "Dremel micro saw cuts a PCB").

Shaft assembly on M5 rod, with stock tail and ball bearings:

Use cardboard to align the cutting disc in the designated hole while the glue hardens:

I used soft tape to wrap the ball bearings before inserting them into place, then soaked them in carpenter glue. This soft mount reduces vibrations:

Finally, I've added rulers on top that help to guide the part being cut and glued everything together:

You can use the flex shaft, but for best results install Dremel in the clamps on the base so it is aligned with the shaft:
