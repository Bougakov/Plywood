DIY plywood designs for Dremel, CNC, PCB fabrication. All of these are meant to be cut from 3mm material. По-русски на ([mysku.ru](https://mysku.ru/blog/aliexpress/69794.html))

*(Please note, my layouts are designed to be cut with a laser with .16mm beam. If yours uses finer beam, you might need to use sandpaper / file to fit the parts together.)*

# Circular mini saw:

44mm cutting discs for Dremel are too heavy and too dangerous. I've mounted one on M6 rod, used ball bearings and inserted the resulting shaft in a custom plywood box. The result is a tiny circular saw which is ideal for cutting PCBs. [See it in action on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyNd7t795UE "Dremel micro saw cuts a PCB").

Shaft assembly on M5 rod, with stock tail and ball bearings:

Use cardboard to align the cutting disc in the designated hole while the glue hardens:

I used soft tape to wrap the ball bearings before inserting them into place, then soaked them in carpenter glue. This soft mount reduces vibrations:

Finally, I've added rulers on top that help to guide the part being cut and glued everything together:

You can use the flex shaft, but for best results install Dremel in the clamps on the base so it is aligned with the shaft:

* [rubber legs](https://letyshops.com/r/aliexpress-m9intrgr468k8)
* [sealed dustproof ball bearing](https://letyshops.com/r/aliexpress-m9intrgq568og)
* You will also need few M3 nuts and washers, and four M4 butterfly nuts to hold the rulers - get these at the local hardware store. 

# Pedal for Dremel

I have built a pedal assembly to allow myself to use both hands while working with Dremel. I used [cheapest plastic pedal switch from AliExpress](https://letyshops.com/r/aliexpress-m9intrgqznk0s) and attached power socket to it. [See it in action on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDY4anWHEY).

First, disassemble the pedal and remove stock rubber feet. Mount it on plywood base using M3 nuts and washers:

On the bottom attach rubber feet:

Insert 2-pin power inlet in the hole on behind, use M3 nuts as well:

Glue everything together, clamp, and put the assembly in some warm place to set:

# Dremel holder 

(uses 50mm plastic plumbing clamps)

# UV PCB resist curing lamp holder

This is the holder for a [9W ultra-violet 365nm curing lamp](https://letyshops.com/r/aliexpress-m9intrgr28g84) used to harden resist films on PCB. Ballast circuit is placed in the handle.
